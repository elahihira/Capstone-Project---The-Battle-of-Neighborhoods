# Capstone-Project-The-Battle-of-Neighborhoods

Introduction:
   The puropose of this Capstone Project is to compare the neighborhoods of the two cities, New York and Toronto, and determine how similar or dissimilar they are. We will get to see the most common venues for both.
 Toronto and New York being the financial capital of Canada and the US respectively are one of the densely populated cities in the world. Both these cities see a lot of  diversity resulting from the movement of a lot of immigrants from several parts of the world for work and settlement. These are one of the most immigrant-friendly cities,  still different in so many aspects, which we are going to observe in this work.
