# Capstone-Project---The-Battle-of-Neighborhoods
####### Problem Statement:
####### This work explains how the neighborhood of Toronto is different, or similar to that of New York City. We will get to see the most common venues for both.
####### Project Background:
####### Toronto and New York being the financial capital of Canada and the US respectively are one of the densely populated cities in the world. Both these cities see a lot of ####### diversity resulting from the movement of a lot of immigrants from several parts of the world for work and settlement. These are one of the most immigrant-friendly cities, ####### still different in so many aspects, which we are going to observe in this work.

####### The purpose of this whole exercise is for submission of the final capstone project for the "IBM Data Science" course on Coursera as well as to showcase my data science ####### skills in the real-world application.
