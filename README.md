# Capstone-Project-The-Battle-of-Neighborhoods

## Introduction:
  
  The puropose of this Capstone Project is to compare the neighborhoods of the two cities, New York and Toronto, and determine how similar or dissimilar they are. We will get to see the most common venues for both.
 Toronto and New York being the financial capital of Canada and the US respectively are one of the densely populated cities in the world. Both these cities see a lot of  diversity resulting from the movement of a lot of immigrants from several parts of the world for work and settlement. These are one of the most immigrant-friendly cities,  still different in so many aspects, which we are going to observe in this work.

##  Problem solving strategy
The idea is to compare Toronto and the New York region for their similarities difference in terms of the most common venues they house. I will specifically compare the number of Indian, Chinese, and American Restaurants in both cities as well as list down the 10 most common venues in both cities Neighborhood wise. The outcome of this study will help tourists and new immigrants have an overview of the common venues in both cities and chalk out the differences between both, which might further help them in their decision of travel or immigration choice. Then explore both cities by using Foursquare API and K-Clustering Approach and visualize the results separately.
